			<h2>Dinosaurs are Cool</h2>
			<p id="hero-content">
				My name is Jaron Andrus. And as a child, dinosaurs were
				incredibly important to me. That was because dinosaurs are
				objectively cool animals. There’s something fascinating about
				creatures that once ruled the Earth—towering, scaly beasts that
				roamed jungles, plains, and oceans, only to vanish in a
				prehistoric cataclysm. The idea that these massive reptiles once
				existed feels almost mythical, yet we have the fossils to prove
				it. And while all dinosaurs are cool in their own way, some
				stand out more than others.

				<p>
					In this site, I want to highlight the dinosaurs that I think
					are the absolute coolest. Whether it’s their size, their
					speed, or just the sheer awe they inspire, these creatures
					deserve recognition. Of course, this list is entirely my
					opinion, but I’ve thought long and hard about it. Every
					dinosaur featured here has earned its spot for a reason, and
					I’m prepared to defend my choices.
				</p>
			</div>

			<p>
				But this isn't just about my opinions—it's about yours too. So
				please, click below to see my reasoning, and let me know what
				you think. Do you agree? Do you think I left out a truly
				legendary dinosaur? I want to hear from you! Share your
				thoughts, and let's celebrate the most incredible creatures to
				ever walk the Earth together.
