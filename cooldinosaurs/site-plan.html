				My name is Jaron Andrus. And as a child, dinosaurs were
				incredibly important to me. That was because dinosaurs are
				objectively cool animals. There’s something fascinating about
				creatures that once ruled the Earth—towering, scaly beasts that
				roamed jungles, plains, and oceans, only to vanish in a
				prehistoric cataclysm. The idea that these massive reptiles once
				existed feels almost mythical, yet we have the fossils to prove
				it. And while all dinosaurs are cool in their own way, some
				stand out more than others. 
                <br><br>
                
                In this site, I want to highlight
				the dinosaurs that I think are the absolute coolest. Whether
				it’s their size, their speed, or just the sheer awe they
				inspire, these creatures deserve recognition. Of course, this
				list is entirely my opinion, but I’ve thought long and hard
				about it. Every dinosaur featured here has earned its spot for a
				reason, and I’m prepared to defend my choices. 
                <br><br>
                But this isn't
				just about my opinions—it's about yours too. So please, click
				below to see my reasoning, and let me know what you think. Do
				you agree? Do you think I left out a truly legendary dinosaur? I
				want to hear from you! Share your thoughts, and let's celebrate
				the most incredible creatures to ever walk the Earth together.
			</p>
			<h3>Spinosaurus</h3>
			<p> 
				Rad, sick, cool, and excellent are all words invented to describe the Spinosaurus.
				Even the name indicates something you do not want to mess with. I'm going to break
				down the top 5 reasons why Spinosaurus is cool.
				<br>
				<br>
				#1 Its the largest carivorous dinosaur ever
				Its even bigger than the hugely overated t-rex and gigantosaurs. Estimates suggest 
				it could be up to 50-60 feet long and weigh around 7-10 tons-making it the largest
				known carnivorous dinosaur.
				<br>
				<br>
				#2 First Known Swimming Dinosaur
				Unlike most theropods, Spinosaurus was semi-aquatic! Fossil evidence suggests it 
				spent much of its time hunting in rivers and lakes, making it the first confirmed swimming dinosaur.
				Making it the best of both worlds.
				<br>
				<br>
				#3 Giant Sail on Its Back
				Its most iconic feature was the massive sail (up to 7 feet tall), formed by elongated 
				vertebrae. While its exact function is debated, it could have been used for display, 
				thermoregulation, or intimidation—either way, it looked awesome.
				<br>
				<br>
				#4 A Crocodile-Like Skull
				Spinosaurus had a long, narrow snout filled with conical teeth, much like a modern 
				crocodile. Crocdiles are cool, so therefore Spinosaurus is cool This adaptation 
				made it perfect for catching slippery fish, reinforcing its semi-aquatic lifestyle.
				<br>
				<br>
				#5 Rivalry With T. rex (Pop Culture Icon Status)
				Thanks to its legendary fight with T. rex in Jurassic Park III (whether scientifically 
				accurate or not), Spinosaurus has become one of the most recognizable dinosaurs in pop 
				culture. That fight may have been controversial, but it cemented Spinosaurus as an absolute beast.
				<br>
				<br>
				Honorable mentions
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It Was a True Prehistoric Monster</li>
				<li>It Lived in an Epic Prehistoric Environment</li>
				<li>Unique Hunting Style</li>
				<li>Could Walk on Land & Swim in Water</li>
				<li>Webbed Feet & Paddle-Like Tail</li>
				<li>This edit exists and is awesome: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/frOjThVAOFo">Sick Spinosaurus edit</a></li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In conclusion the Spinosaurus was a cool dinosaur. The is like a cross between a crocodile and a t-rex
				except it surpases it in every way. With actual sizable arms, being profeciant in water, and being bigger.

			<h3>Dilophosaurus</h3>
			<p> 
				Perhaps God had to take a break from making awesome stuff after creating the Dilophosaurus
				and thats why he made them exctint. They are just that cool. Read ahead to see the details 
				why that is.
				<br>
				<br>
				#1 The Double-Crested King  
				Dilophosaurus rocked not one, but two crests on its head, making it look like the  
				prehistoric equivalent of a punk rock icon. While the exact function of these crests  
				is debated, they were likely used for intimidation, display, or communication—  
				all of which are undeniably rad.  
				<br>
				<br>
				#2 One of the First Large Theropods  
				Living during the Early Jurassic, Dilophosaurus was one of the first big carnivorous  
				dinosaurs. At around 23 feet long and 900 lbs, it wasn’t the biggest predator of all time,  
				but for its era, it was a terrifying apex predator that dominated the landscape.  
				<br>
				<br>
				#3 Speed and Agility Over Brutality  
				Unlike bulky, slow-moving predators, Dilophosaurus was fast and agile. Its lightweight  
				frame, long legs, and sharp claws made it a swift hunter, likely able to chase down prey  
				with ease. Think of it as the Jurassic Parkour master.  
				<br>
				<br>
				#4 Its Jaw Was Built Differently  
				Unlike many theropods with reinforced skulls, Dilophosaurus had a more flexible upper jaw.  
				This likely helped it latch onto struggling prey and tear off chunks of flesh with precision.  
				While some thought it had a weak bite, new research suggests it was more than capable of  
				handling big meals.  
				<br>
				<br>
				#5 Even cooler than the movies  
				While the real Dilophosaurus didn’t have a frill or spit venom, its portrayal in  
				Jurassic Park made it an instant legend. In reality the Dilophosaurus was even more 
				terrifying. The shrimpy chicken sized dinosaur in the movie was actually 6 feet tall
				and 20 feet long in the Jurassic Park novel and actual history.
				<br>
				<br>
				Honorable mentions  
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>One of the Earliest True Theropods</li>
				<li>Possibly Hunted in Packs</li>
				<li>Lived in an Ancient, Exotic Jurassic World</li>
				<li>Its Skull Resembles a Dragon</li>
				<li>Its Name Literally Means "Two-Crested Lizard"</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Dilophosaurus was a cool dinosaur.  
				It had the speed, intelligence, and looks to stand out from the crowd.  
				Whether or not it actually spit venom (it didn’t), the legacy it left in pop culture is undeniable.

            <h3>Allosaurus</h3>
			<p> 
				Allosaurus is an underrated legend. And one of my personal child hood favorite dinosaurs.  
				So I will 100% take it personally if you disagree. So lets get into 5 reasons why Allosaurus
				is cool.
				<br>
				<br>
				#1 The Apex Predator of the Jurassic  
				While T. rex ruled the late Cretaceous, Allosaurus was the undisputed king of the Jurassic period.  
				At around 30-40 feet long and weighing up to 2.5 tons, this beast was the top predator of its time,  
				taking down huge herbivores like Stegosaurus and Diplodocus. In comparison t-rex got up to 40 feet 
				long. And Allosaurus had less of a wimpy arm problem.
				<br>
				<br>
				#2 A Mouth Full of Serrated Knives  
				Allosaurus had razor-sharp, serrated teeth designed for slicing through flesh. Unlike T. rex,  
				which crushed bones, Allosaurus used its teeth like a prehistoric steak knife, making it a  
				terrifyingly efficient killer.  
				<br>
				<br>
				#3 Its Hunting Style Was Absolutely Brutal  
				Scientists believe Allosaurus used a "hatchet bite" technique—swinging its head down  
				and tearing huge chunks out of prey. Some studies suggest its skull was flexible,  
				allowing it to open its mouth insanely wide, like a snake, to take massive bites.  
				<br>
				<br>
				#4 It Hunted in Packs (Maybe)  
				Fossil evidence suggests that Allosaurus may have hunted in groups, making it one of the  
				earliest examples of cooperative hunting. Imagine a pack of these 30-foot killers  
				swarming a massive sauropod—pure nightmare fuel.  
				<br>
				<br>
				#5 It’s Been in Almost Every Dinosaur Documentary Ever  
				Whether it’s Walking with Dinosaurs, Dinosaur Revolution, or Prehistoric Planet,  
				Allosaurus always gets the spotlight. It’s basically the rockstar of Jurassic carnivores,  
				and for good reason. Although it is lesser known by the general public. Which is just
				dissapointing.  
				<br>
				<br>
				Honorable mentions  
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>It Had Wickedly Long Claws for Slashing</li>
				<li>One of the Most Well-Preserved Dinosaur Fossils ("Big Al")</li>
				<li>Lived Alongside Some of the Most Famous Dinosaurs</li>
				<li>Had a Flexible Skull for Maximum Bite Efficiency</li>
				<li>Faster and More Agile Than a T. rex</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				In conclusion, the Allosaurus was a cool dinosaur.  
				It was the apex predator of its era, had some of the most vicious hunting tactics,  
				and honestly doesn’t get as much love as it deserves.  
				Let me know if you disagree down below!
