			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a href="https://coolors.co/3e7644-000000-763e70" target="_blank"
				>https://coolors.co/3e7644-000000-763e70</a
			>

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>
					</tr>
					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#3e7644]</td>
						<td class="secondary">[#000000]</td>
						<td class="accent1">[#763E70]</td>
						<td class="accent2"></td>
					</tr>
				</tbody>
			</table>

			<!-- ------------------------Step 9------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			<!-- Choose a font for your paragraphs (body copy) and headlines. What font(s) have you chosen? Why did you choose what you did?  Make sure to review the list of web safe fonts at W3Schools.org as a starting point.  Think also about which of your colors above you might use for background and font colors. -->

			<h4>
				Heading Font: Lilita One
				<!-- This font matches the logo pretty well and gives a child like prehistoric vibe -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Open Sans
				<!-- This font is easy to read and contradicts the stylized header font -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>

				My name is Jaron Andrus. And as a child, dinosaurs were
				incredibly important to me. That was because dinosaurs are
				objectively cool animals. There’s something fascinating about
				creatures that once ruled the Earth—towering, scaly beasts that
				roamed jungles, plains, and oceans, only to vanish in a
				prehistoric cataclysm. The idea that these massive reptiles once
				existed feels almost mythical, yet we have the fossils to prove
				it. And while all dinosaurs are cool in their own way, some
				stand out more than others. 
                <br><br>
                
                In this site, I want to highlight
				the dinosaurs that I think are the absolute coolest. Whether
				it’s their size, their speed, or just the sheer awe they
				inspire, these creatures deserve recognition. Of course, this
				list is entirely my opinion, but I’ve thought long and hard
				about it. Every dinosaur featured here has earned its spot for a
				reason, and I’m prepared to defend my choices. 
                <br><br>
                But this isn't
				just about my opinions—it's about yours too. So please, click
				below to see my reasoning, and let me know what you think. Do
				you agree? Do you think I left out a truly legendary dinosaur? I
				want to hear from you! Share your thoughts, and let's celebrate
				the most incredible creatures to ever walk the Earth together.
